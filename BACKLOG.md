- [ ] Integrate Swagger for API documentation.
- [ ] Provide OpenAPI documentation for:
    - [ ] Endpoint definitions

    - [ ] MigLayout
    - [ ] GridBagLayout
- [ ] Develop interfaces for:
    - [ ] Employee CRUD operations
    - [ ] Search and filtering
    - [ ] Reporting and statistics
    - [ ] Role-based views
- [ ] Implement user authentication.

---

### 9. Testing
#### Tasks:
- [ ] Write unit tests with JUnit for:
    - [ ] Validation logic
    - [ ] Service methods
    - [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Write integration tests with Mockito for:
    - [ ] API endpoints
    - [ ] Database operations
- [ ] Validate API endpoints using Postman:
    - [ ] Create a Postman collection for all endpoints.
    - [ ] Test CRUD operations and role-based access.
    - [ ] Include validation tests for edge cases.

---

### 10. Docker Integration
#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create a Dockerfile for the backend application.
- [ ] Create a Docker Compose file to include:
    - [ ] Java backend container
    - [ ] Oracle SQL container
- [ ] Test the application locally using Docker.

---

### 11. Documentation
#### Tasks:
- [ ] Maintain Markdown documentation for:
    - [ ] Project setup and requirements.
    - [ ] API endpoints (Swagger/OpenAPI link).
    - [ ] UI usage guide.
    - [ ] Testing guide (JUnit, Postman).
- [ ] Write this backlog in Markdown format.

---

### 12. Deployment
#### Tasks:
- [ ] Provide instructions for deploying the application locally with Docker.
- [ ] Ensure the Docker image is portable and includes all dependencies.

---

### Stretch Goals
- [ ] Implement pagination for search results.
- [ ] Add email notifications for specific actions (e.g., new hires).
- [ ] Provide detailed analytics on employee performance (future extension).

## Notes:
- **Priority**: Core functionality (CRUD, roles, validation) takes precedence.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure Oracle SQL and Java 17 compatibility.
- **Milestones**:
    - MVP: Core CRUD functionality with API and basic UI.
    - Full System: Role-based permissions, audit logging, reporting, and UI.
